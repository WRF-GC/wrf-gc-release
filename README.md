## WRF-GC

This is the official repository for the **WRF-GC** model, an online two-way coupling of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the [GEOS-Chem](https://geos-chem.seas.harvard.edu/) atmospheric chemistry model.

## About WRF-GC

[WRF-GC](https://fugroup.org/index.php/WRF-GC) is an online two-way coupled meteorology-chemistry model using WRF to drive GEOS-Chem chemistry. It is developed by [Haipeng Lin](https://jimmielin.me/), [Xu Feng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xu-Feng-11), and [Tzung-May Fu](https://fugroup.org) and based at the [Atmospheric Chemistry & Climate Group at SUSTech](https://fugroup.org).

The WRF-GC model includes a versatile coupler coupling GEOS-Chem to WRF in a manner similar to WRF-Chem, making it seamless for WRF-Chem users to use WRF-GC and allowing GEOS-Chem users access to WRF-simulated online weather, with the capability for hindcasts and forecasts.

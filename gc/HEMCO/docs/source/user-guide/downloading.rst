Downloading HEMCO
=================

When cloning HEMCO you will get the :literal:`main` branch by default.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/geoschem/hemco.git HEMCO


If you would like a different version of HEMCO you can checkout the branch or tag from the top-level
directory. If you have any unsaved changes, make sure you commit those to a branch prior to updating versions.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd HEMCO
   $ git checkout tags/3.0.0

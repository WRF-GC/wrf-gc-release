# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for looking into contributing to HEMCO! HEMCO is a grass-roots model that relies on contributions from community members like you. Whether you're new to HEMCO or a longtime user, you're a valued member of the community, and we want you to feel empowered to contribute.

## We use GitHub and ReadTheDocs
We use GitHub to host the HEMCO source code, to track issues, user questions, and feature requests, and to accept pull requests: [https://github.com/geoschem/geos-chem](https://github.com/geoschem/HEMCO). Please help out as you can in response to issues and user questions.

HEMCO documentation can be found at [hemco.readthedocs.io](https://hemco.readthedocs.io).

## How can I submit updates?
We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all changes happen through pull requests. This workflow is [described here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

As the author you are responsible for:
- Testing your changes
- Updating the user documentation (if applicable)
- Supporting issues and questions related to your changes

### Coding conventions
The HEMCO codebase dates back several years and includes contributions from many people and multiple organizations. Therefore, some inconsistent conventions are inevitable, but we ask that you do your best to be consistent with nearby code.

! !MODULE: hcoio_dataread_mod.F90
!
! !DESCRIPTION: Module HCOIO\_DataRead\_Mod controls data processing
! for HEMCO.
! Depending on the model environment (standard, ESMF, etc.), it invokes
! the corresponding routines to read the data from file, convert units
! as required, and interpolate the data onto the model grid.
!\\
!\\
! Currently, HEMCO can read data from the following data sources:
! \begin{itemize}
! \item Gridded data from netCDF file. The netCDF file should adhere to
!   the COARDS conventions and can hold data on resolutions different
!   than then simulation grid. Regridding is performed as part of the
!   data reading. Routine HCOIO\_DataRead is the driver routine to read
!   data from netCDF file. In an ESMF environment, this routine simply
!   calls down to the MAPL/ESMF - generic I/O routines. In a non-ESMF
!   environment, the HEMCO generic reading and remapping algorithms are
!   used. Those support vertical regridding, unit conversion, and more
!   (see below).
! \item Scalar data directly specified in the HEMCO configuration file.
!   If multiple values - separated by the separator sign (/) - are
!   provided, they are interpreted as temporally changing values:
!   7 values = Sun, Mon, ..., Sat; 12 values = Jan, Feb, ..., Dec;
!   24 values = 0am, 1am, ..., 23pm (local time!). For masks, exactly
!   four values must be provided, interpreted as lower left and upper
!   right mask box corners (lon1/lat1/lon2/lat2).
! \item Country-specific data specified in a separate ASCII file. This
!   file must end with the suffix '.txt' and hold the country specific
!   values listed by country ID. The IDs must correspond to the IDs of
!   a corresponding (netCDF) mask file. The container name of this mask
!   file must be given in the first line of the file, and must be listed
!   HEMCO configuration file. ID 0 is reserved for the default values,
!   applied to all countries with no specific values listed. The .txt
!   file must be structured as follows:
!
!   \# Country mask file name
!   CountryMask
!
!   \# CountryName CountryID CountryValues
!   DEFAULT   0 1.0/1.0/1.0/1.0/1.0/1.0/1/0
!   USA     840 0.8/0.9/1.0/1.1/1.2/1.1/0.9
!
!   The CountryValues are interpreted the same way as scalar values,
!   except that they are applied to all grid boxes with the given
!   country ID.
! \end{itemize}
!
! Outside of an ESMF environment, the GEOS-Chem netCDF reading utilities
! are used to read netCDF data from disk. The selection of the time slice
! to be read depends on the current simulation time and the datetime
! settings assigned to a given data container (set in the configuration
! file). These settings include:
! \begin{itemize}
! \item datetime range (srcTime), given as YYYY/MM/DD/hh. These can be
!  given as fixed date (e.g. 2010/1/1/0), ranges (e.g. 1990-2010/1/1/0
!  or 2000-2100/1-12/0/0-23), or using tokens (e.g. $YYYY/$MM/1/0).
!  Data is automatically updated if a 'dynamic' time attribute is given.
!  For instance, for attribute $YYYY/1/1/0 the file will be updated
!  every year, attribute $YYYY/$MM/$DD/0 every day, etc. The date time
!  tokens are replaced with the current simulation datetime. If a range
!  is provided, only time stamps within the given range are being used.
!  If there is no exact match between the preferred datetime (determined
!  from srcTime) and the time slices in the netCDF file, the cycle flag
!  determines what time slice index is selected.
! \item Cycling behavior. This determines what to do if there is no
!  exact match between preferred datetime and available datetimes of a
!  file. The options are cycling (C, default), range (R), exact (E),
!  and interpolation (I). If cycling is used, data is recycled if the
!  simulation time is outside of the available data time interval.
!  If cycling is set to range, a data container is ignored if the
!  *simulation* time is outside the given range. For example, if the
!  range is set to 2010-2015/1-12/1/0, this data container is used
!  for simulation dates between 2010 and 2015. If the actual netCDF
!  file data is outside that range, the closest available time slice
!  is selected using the algorithm described below.
!  If cycling is set to exact, HEMCO returns w/ an error if no time
!  slice can be found in the netCDF file that exactly matches the
!  preferred time slices.
!  Finally, if interpolation is selected, data will be interpolated
!  between two time slices if the current preferred datetime cannot
!  be found in the input data.
!  If the preferred datetime does not match with any of the ncdf
!  datetimes, the following method is used to select the time slice
!  to be used:
!  If the preferred datetime is within the range of the available
!  dates, the closest available time stamp in the past is used in
!  most cases. For example, assume a file contains January data
!  between 2005 and 2010, and a simulation starts on July 2007. In
!  this case, the data from Jan 2007 will be used and replaced with
!  Jan 2008 as soon as the simulation date changes to 2008.
!  If the datetimes of the netCDF file contain discontinuities (e.g.
!  don't have the same time interval between all time stamps), an
!  attempt is made to maintain the highest cycling frequency. For
!  instance, if a file contains monthly data for years 2005 and 2020
!  and the srcTime attribute is set to $YYYY/1-12/1/0. For July 2008,
!  this will use the data from July 2005, and not December 2005 (which
!  would be the closest date). Data is updated to Aug 2005 once the
!  simulation time changes to Aug 2008.
!  The same principles are applied if the current datetime is outside
!  the data range of the ncdf file, but in this case it is also
!  possible to use datetimes in the future.
!  If the interpolation option is enabled, the second time slice is
!  selected in the same manner as for slice 1, but for future dates.
!  If there is no additional time step in a file, e.g. the selected
!  time slice is the only/last one of a file, a check is made to see
!  if there is another file with the same filename but other datetime
!  tokens. If this is the case, interpolation will be performed between
!  these two files. Note that at the moment, the first time slice of
!  the second file is always used!!
!  For example, assume data for years 2005 and 2010 is stored in files
!  file2005.nc and file2010.nc, respectively. The following entries
!  in the HEMCO configuration file will enable annual interpolation
!  between these two files:
!  0 TEST file$YYYY.nc VAL 2005-2010/1/1/0 I ...

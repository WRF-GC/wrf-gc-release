This directory contains example run scripts and environment files
for several compute clusters that are actively being used for GCHP
simulations and development. Contact information is included in the
README within each subdirectory.

If you have multiple users on your compute cluster then please do
consider submitting the run and environment files for your compute
cluster to include in this directory. To propose including your
files in an upcoming version you may create an issue on the
GEOS-Chem GitHub issues page:

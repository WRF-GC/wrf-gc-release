# Example Run Scripts

This folder contains:

(1) template file 'gchp.batch_job.sh' to adapt for submitting GCHP batch
    jobs for various schedulers (PBS, LSF, and SLURM)

(2) template file 'gchp.local.sh' to adapt for running GCHP on the command line

(3) subdirectory 'operational_examples' containing job scripts and
    environment files used regularly on specific systems.

If you are running GCHP on a system in 'operational_examples' then you can
copy and adapt a job script from that folder. If you are running on a
different system then you should copy and adapt one of the template files.

If you have a working run script on a system with several GCHP users please
consider submitting it to the GEOS-Chem Support Team for inclusion in
'operational_examples' in a future version. This will make it easier for
users on your system to get started with GCHP. To get started, create
a GEOS-Chem GitHub issue at:
https://github.com/geoschem/geos-chem/issues/

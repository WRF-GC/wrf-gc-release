%%%                        The length variable \captionwidth controls
%%%                        how the caption is typeset.  If the width
%%%                        of the caption is less than \captionwidth,
%%%                        the \hangcaption is typeset the same way a
%%%                        short \caption would be (usually centered).
%%%                        Otherwise, it is set as shown above, with a
%%%                        total width equal to \captionwidth.
%%%                        \captionwidth is set to \hsize normally,
%%%                        but you may want to change it temporarily
%%%                        to match the width of a \tabular*
%%%                        environment, for example.
%%%
%%%                        \hangcaption is used in the same way as
%%%                        \caption.  To retain compatibility with
%%%                        previous versions of this style, the
%%%                        \hangcaption is also available under the
%%%                        name \isucaption.

%%%                        I did not write this file.  The original
%%%                        author is unknown.  However, I did fix a bug,
%%%                        namely, I removed a superflous "^^" that was
%%%                        causing one of the close braces to be
%%%                        interpreted as an equals sign, thus messing
%%%                        up the brace balancing.  I also tacked an
%%%                        "\endinput" on to the end of the file and
%%%                        added this header, and incorporated a few
%%%                        changes suggested by Harm Bakker, George
%%%                        Greenwade, and Rainer Schoepf.
%%%
%%%                        v2.00 (27 Aug 1992): altered \numberline to
%%%                        use \the... instead of \fnum@... (fix due to
%%%                        Harm Bakker <bakker@cs.rulimburg.nl>).
%%%                        Changed \isucaption to \hangcaption at George
%%%                        Greenwade's <bed_gdg@SHSU.edu> suggestion.
%%%
%%%                        v1.03 (12 August 1992): minor changes to
%%%                        header.
%%%
%%%                        v1.02 (12 August 1992): patches by Rainer
%%%                        Schoepf <schoepf@sc.ZIB-Berlin.DE> to (a)
%%%                        work around a bug in LaTeX and (b) measure
%%%                        the caption correctly by including room for
%%%                        the colon and the space.

%%%                        The checksum field above contains a CRC-16
%%%                        checksum as the first value, followed by the
